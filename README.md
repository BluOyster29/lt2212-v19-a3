# LT2212 V19 Assignment 3

From Asad Sayeed's statistical NLP course at the University of Gothenburg.

My name: Robert Rhys Thomas

## Additional instructions

I have added -T and -P for specifying the test range and for using pos tags instead of words. -T is the percentage of the training set that you want to use. I have also automated the output of statistics, the program adds to the 'results' folder a folder with the name of the output file and will add to the folder the training/testing dataframes, the model and finally add to it a markdown file with the statistics, the program will also then zip up the training/test files so that they can easily be pushed/pulled to github. You need to remember to put the full file extension when specifying datafiles e.g results/50_lines/50_lines_training.csv. 

## Reporting for Part 4



## Reporting for Part Bonus 

I added a small bit of code that outputs the pos one-hot vectors instead of the words.
